advanced-french
===============

> This application is my first programming project. I use it to learn Ruby and the basics of web application development. 

> The site displays lessons and exercises for advanced French learners.
> It is inspired by another website I was using to give my students online homework when I was teaching French.

Using the site without logging in
---------------------------------

> Anyone can read the lessons and try to answer the exercises questions. The correct answers will be saved until the end of the session.

Using the site as a logged in user
----------------------------------

> New users can only be added to the database via a Rake task.
> Then, a signed up user can log in, read the lessons and try to answer the exercises questions. His/her correct answers will be saved and available the next time he/she logs in.
